# Setting

## Velherak

The World of Velherak is vast and filled with many strange creatures, myths and tribes of man struggling to survive.

> _**Forget everything you know about fantasy, and prepare to enter the Mythical Stone Age**_

_You are not a super hero or mighty warrior. You live in a scary, unknowable and uncaring world_

As a player of “Under Shadow of Night” you must be prepared for what the game has to offer. This game focuses on legacy, generational storytelling, the mythical, horror and the inconvenience of the stone age.

As a player character you have a Sacred Duty to perform in the Community, outside these duties you are an ordinary member of the people and join in on the many tasks to be done, and the play.

#### The Wilderness

Nature is widespread, forests reach seemingly endless across the lands, interrupted by mountains, far reaching plains and craggy hills.

The wilderness is seldom quiet for it is full of life. Flora and fauna of all sizes, and in great numbers. Though they know to shy away from our people, as we do to shun away from them.

Amongst the fauna are the greatest critters upon the land, the lumbering Megafauna, great beasts not to be underestimated with their ferocity or gentleness.

* \[ ] TODO: The Nature you see today, is not normal. True Nature un-groomed by man is much stranger and wilder.

#### Knowledge

Any ordinary person will know what plants are edible, what paths are safe, and have a good mental map of the land of the people, and have basic hunting or gathering skills.

You also know there are strange gods walking these lands, and that they have been here longer than your kin. You know there are living shadows, nightmares that eat your spirit, accursed monsters who spreads an unnatural rot and all manner of strange creatures to be wary of.

#### Technology

Stone, Wood, Bone,

Metal is very rare and viewed as magic or the work of gods

* \[ ] TODO: Cold Forging of metals

_You may find reference to Iron in this book, this is not in reference to the metal but to its unbendable qualities. Imagine that Iron was a word before it were given to the metal._

#### Society

Equal, everyone has to work, gather, hunt, play.

* \[ ] TODO: Work to Live, not live to work. Plenty of time for culture, craft and play

#### Convenience

Things take time, there are no shops, there may be seasonal markets, but things take a lot of time and resources to make. You cannot earn money just to buy things, you need to barter, to trade or in rare cases, have the specific currency.

Clothes may take months to make, ritual garbs take years.

#### “Magic”

Ritual, folklore and wisdom takes the place of modern magic. The world breathes of the otherworldly. Common means are seen as tools to deal with spirits and shadows, or to imbue the ordinary with mythical traits.

Talismans, amulets and rites are the actions of the ordinary to protect against or reach towards the otherworldly.

## Living Myths

There are many mythical creatures, spirits and entities in the world, all these creatures bear the same name as the world, they are known as The Velherak. These are as living myths and few bear any similarity to one another, but for the people of this land they employ three monikers for the kind of Velherak one may face.

### The Accursed

Monsters of Singular Thought. Once an ordinary creature, they were cursed by others, or themselves into an obsession which now rules their very being. This curse manifests upon their being, making them monstrous.

### The Unseen

The Unseen are Velherak who can only be felt by their presence, or seen by their affect on the world around them. Some are known to be wicked as the living shadows, that seek to consume the essence of any they find, while others are more benign, unless angered.

### The Wise

The wise, and most often old is a categorisation given to elder things and the physical spirits of the land. These are those who have grown old and attained the wisdom of ages, meaning they are thinking creatures, often with incomprehensible thought and plans, but thinking still.
