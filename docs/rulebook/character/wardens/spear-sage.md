## The Rot

> _This **Knowledge** is secret and is your burden to bear._

From wounds in the wilds they form, the Rot, also known as the blood curse. A strange sickness upon the land which cares not what it infects, be it man, creature, stone, water or wind. It is a dreadful thing that slowly rots one from within, leaving a haunting monstrous thing behind which moves and acts as if driven by an otherworldly will.

The Rot can take many forms, often it is unseen by ordinary eyes, only the keen eyed, young or very old see it spreading, other times it can take on the form of a crimson blanket that covers all it touches, as if a great fungus moves to consume the entire world.

Any creature taken by the rot slowly wastes away, and in time will become a nest from which the Rot spreads further on. There are remedies that can banish the rot, but what has been lost can never be regained, if one has wasted away too far, one shall never recover.

Your kin found the right ingredients to brew remedies to stand against this rot, and the rites that rattle the rotted, you have inherited this knowledge and must protect your people if the Rot ever arises again.
